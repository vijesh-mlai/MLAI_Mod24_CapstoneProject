## üìò Project Overview
This project aims to **predict the menu price of restaurant items** within the **State of Texas** using machine learning techniques.  
The analysis leverages detailed restaurant data ‚Äî including customer ratings, cuisine types, price ranges, and regional demographics ‚Äî to help businesses and investors make data-driven decisions about restaurant pricing and strategy.

Although the current analysis focuses on Texas due to computational efficiency, the same predictive framework can be **extended to other U.S. states** for wider market insights.

## üéØ Business Objective
To empower restaurant owners and entrepreneurs with insights on:
- **Key factors influencing menu pricing**
- **Competitive pricing dynamics across Texas**
- **Opportunities for new restaurant ventures based on data-driven price predictions**

## üß† Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation
- Original dataset: ~5M rows (nationwide)
- Texas State subset: ~1.2M rows (Texas-focused)
- Sample Subset for Validating the Model: ~30K rows
- Preprocessing included:
  - Regex extraction for item quantities and units
  - Text normalization and cleaning
  - Feature derivation (`item_qty`, `item_unit`, `item_size_label`, `zip3`)
  - Mapping price ranges (`$`, `$$`, `$$$`, `$$$$` ‚Üí numeric codes)

### 2. Feature Engineering
- **Numeric:** `score`, `review`, `price_range`, `item_qty`, `item_size_inch`
- **Categorical:** `restaurant_category`, `zip_code`, `item_unit`, `item_size_label`
- **Text:** TF-IDF transformation on `item_name`

### 3. Modeling
| Model | Description |
|:------|:-------------|
| **Linear Regression** | Baseline model with basic feature relationships |
| **Ridge Regression** | Regularized model to handle mild multicollinearity |
| **Lasso Regression** | Sparse model with higher regularization |
| **Random Forest** | Non-linear ensemble method with strong generalization |
| **XGBoost** | Gradient-boosted trees, best performance overall |

Evaluation metrics: RMSE, MSE, and R¬≤  
Target variable (`menu_price`) was **log-transformed** for variance stabilization.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Model Performance Summary

| Model | Key Characteristics | Test RMSE | R¬≤ (Test) | Remarks |
|:------|:--------------------|:----------|:-----------|:--------|
| Linear Regression | Moderate bias, limited ability to capture non-linear patterns | 6.33 | 0.36 | Serves as baseline |
| Ridge Regression | Similar to Linear Regression ‚Äî minor improvement | 6.35 | 0.36 | Low multicollinearity |
| Lasso Regression | Strong underfitting due to high regularization | 7.78 | 0.04 | Coefficient shrinkage |
| Random Forest | Captures non-linear relations well; slight overfitting | 5.75 | 0.47 | Balanced performance |
| XGBoost | Best performing model ‚Äî captures complex interactions | 5.06 | 0.59 | Mild overfitting observed |

## üèÅ Results

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Main Takeaway
Machine learning models ‚Äî particularly **XGBoost** and **Random Forest** ‚Äî can effectively predict menu prices using both structured and text-based restaurant features.  
Text signals (from `item_name`) combined with categorical and numeric context significantly improved predictive accuracy.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusions
- Combining structured and unstructured data improves prediction reliability.
- Log-transformation stabilized price skewness and boosted accuracy.
- Tree-based models outperformed linear ones due to non-linear relationships.
- The methodology is **scalable and generalizable** beyond Texas.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Business Recommendations
For customers and entrepreneurs exploring restaurant opportunities in Texas:
- **Cuisine Strategy:** Invest in cuisines showing strong customer retention and value alignment (e.g., fast casual, coffee, local comfort food).
- **Regional Pricing:** Assess ZIP-code clusters; urban and high-density areas support premium pricing.
- **Menu Planning:** Use model insights to price competitively without undervaluing popular items.
- **Market Gaps:** Identify categories with low supply but high predicted price stability.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Future Enhancements
- Expand model application to **nationwide data** for cross-state comparison.
- Integrate **time-series or seasonal features** for dynamic pricing.
- Upgrade text modeling using **BERT or Word2Vec embeddings**.
- Build an **interactive dashboard (Streamlit/Power BI)** for visualization.
- Incorporate **socioeconomic and delivery trend data** for better contextual pricing.

## üìà Impact
This project provides a **data-driven decision framework** to help restaurant owners, investors, and analysts:
- Predict item-level prices with improved accuracy  
- Identify profitable restaurant categories  
- Optimize menu pricing based on local market factors  

The approach delivers **scalable, interpretable, and actionable insights** applicable to any food delivery market.
